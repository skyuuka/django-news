This Django app that provides a simple news functionality for your website/project. 

Features and Components:
------------------------

It provides with a 
    1. News Heading:
        The heading of the article. This can be empty.

    2. News Body:
        The news piece. This cannot be left blank.

    3. Publish Date:
        The date you want your news to show up. Can be left blank,

    4. Unpublish Date:
        The date you want your news article to stop showing on the page. Can be left blank,

    5. Order:
        Order of the post/news piece. This order will decide the order of your news articles. 
        Cannot be left blank.

The relationship between publish_date and unpublish_date is simple when both are present. When you leave one or both blank, then it goes something like this:

    * if publish_date and unpublish_date are both None. => Show
    * if publish_date is None and unpublish_date is > Now => show
    * if unpublish_date is None and publish_date is < Now => show

Niceties to have:
-----------------

    1. A check that deecides whether 'Order' should be used or publish_date or create_date or modified_date for ordering the news articles
    2. Check to see if the ordering should be in ascending or descending order.
    3.
